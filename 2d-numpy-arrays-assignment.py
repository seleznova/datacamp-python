# Exercise 1

# Create baseball, a list of lists
baseball = [[180, 78.4],
            [215, 102.7],
            [210, 98.5],
            [188, 75.2]]

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D Numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the type of np_baseball
print(type(np_baseball))

# Print out the shape of np_baseball
print(np_baseball.shape)

# Exercise 2

# baseball is available as a regular list of lists

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D Numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the shape of np_baseball
print(np_baseball.shape)

# Exercise 3

# baseball is available as a regular list of lists

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create np_baseball (2 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the 50th row of np_baseball
print(np_baseball[49,:])

# Select the entire second column of np_baseball: np_weight
np_weight = np_baseball[:, 1]

# Print out height of 124th player
print(np_baseball[123, 0])

# Exercise 4
# baseball is available as a regular list of lists
# update is available as 2D Numpy array

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create np_baseball (3 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out addition of np_baseball and update
print(np_baseball + update)

# Create Numpy array: conversion
conversion = [0.0254, 0.453592, 1]

# Print out product of np_baseball and conversion
print(np_baseball * conversion)
