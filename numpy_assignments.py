# Create list baseball
baseball = [180, 215, 210, 210, 188, 176, 209, 200]

# Import the numpy package as np
import numpy as np

# Create a Numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out type of np_baseball
print(type(np_baseball))

# Exercice 2

# height is available as a regular list

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create a Numpy array from height: np_height
np_height = np.array(height)

# Print out np_height
print(np_height)

# Convert np_height to m: np_height_m
np_height_m = np_height * 0.0254

# Print np_height_m
print(np_height_m)

# height and weight are available as a regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create array from height with correct units: np_height_m
np_height_m = np.array(height) * 0.0254

# Create array from weight with correct units: np_weight_kg
np_weight_kg = np.array(weight) * 0.453592

# Calculate the BMI: bmi
bmi = np_weight_kg / np_height_m ** 2

# Print out bmi
print (bmi)

# Next exerecise

# height and weight are available as a regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Calculate the BMI: bmi
np_height_m = np.array(height) * 0.0254
np_weight_kg = np.array(weight) * 0.453592
bmi = np_weight_kg / np_height_m ** 2

# Create the light array
light = np.array(bmi<21)

# Print out light
print(light)

# Print out BMIs of all baseball players whose BMI is below 21
print(bmi[light])

# Quiz

# Correct answer: np.array([4, 3, 0]) + np.array([0, 2, 2])
